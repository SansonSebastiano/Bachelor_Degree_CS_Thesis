This document describes the work carried out during the internship period at the company RiskApp S.R.L.

The internship project consists of the design and creation of a mobile application for managing notes. The notes are related to meetings between business users who work on the move and customers, and consist of a summary of the meeting itself.
The purpose of these notes is to keep track of all the negotiations of an insurance company.

There are many objectives to be achieved. Among the mandatory ones are the development of the user interface and basic functions: login, creation, modification, deletion and display of notes.
While, among the optional objectives are the automation of the creation process, the implementation of tests for verification and validation and finally the deployment of the application on the all platforms.
